## Easy LESS

Easily work with LESS files in Visual Studio Code. "Compile-on-save" for LESS stylesheets without using a build task.

<InlineNotification>

**Heads Up:** Easy LESS is great, but it can make a serious mess. Make sure to configure a <a href="#">code-workspace</a> for your project! Without configuration, Easy LESS will create a CSS file for _every_ LESS file you save. This is rarely, if ever desired.
