## Quick Reference

VSCode for Lava implements all filters in Rock RMS (up to V11.4). Additional documentation is coming soon, but for now you can reference the official lava documentation at https://community.rockrms.com/lava/filters.

To access a filter, just start typing! Many filters have additional options included inside of the snippet, which can be accessed by pressing the return key when suggestions are shown.
