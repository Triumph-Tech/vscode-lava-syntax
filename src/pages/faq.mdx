## Is this extension avalible for Visual Studio?

Unfortunately, Visual Studio does not allow external language imports in `tmLanguage` files. This would only allow syntax highlighting on Lava, and exclude all HTML tags. (As well as CSS, LESS, SQL, and C++). Due to this limitation, there are currently no plans to create a plugin for Visual Studio.

### But I really want Lava in Visual Studio!

</Row>

**Why not use both?** Use Visual Studio for writing C++ code, compiling, and running Rock... and use Visual Studio Code for Lava and frontend development. Visual Studio Code is <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/introvideos/basics">easy to learn</a> and <a href="https://www.vscodecandothat.com/">awesome</a>.


## What about ________? / Can I ________?

Sure! Why not? Submit your suggestions, ideas and fixes on <a href="https://github.com/garrettjohnson/vscode-lava-syntax/issues/new">GitHub</a> or to <a href="mailto:lava@garrett.io">lava@garrett.io</a>.

_Please note that due to time constraints requests to port Lava for VSCode to another editor (Atom, Brackets, vim etc.) probably won't happen. Sorry!_


## Is the Lava Extension for VSCode officially supported by Spark Development Network?

No. This extension proudly part of the Rock RMS community as an open-source endevor. We accept bugs and feature requests through <a href="https://github.com/garrettjohnson/vscode-lava-syntax/issues/new">GitHub</a>.
